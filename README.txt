EnclosureCalc is project developed by Jukka Vatjus-Anttila. This program aims to be simple yet powerful
subwoofer enclosure design tool. User can give parameters and program calculates enclosure volume, tuning
frequency for ported box, etc. For now this is purely command line python software but GUI is high on the 
required-features list.

This project acts as my python-language training platform, because I have not ever written anything with 
this language. Hoping for the best and expecting worst. LinuxISD is on its way.

Version history: 
  10.7.2011 v0.1, first implementation of simple volume calculator using user given inputs
  11.7.2011 v0.2, Started implementing enclosureManager class
  12.7.2011 v0.2.5 Continued class development. Also slight optimizations to code structure.
  15.7.2011 v0.2.9 Made github project and separated test method and enclosureManager class to different files.
